# CRUSHBLAS
**BLAS-like linear algebra**, **modern encryption** and **lossless compression**
### FEATURES 
(Please note this is a temporary list, 
I'm still mapping out all the features and their implementations)
- BLAS-level linear algebra operations
- AES-256 and ChaCha20 encryption
- LZ4 and Zstd compression
- Zero-copy encrypted compressed data
- CPU/GPU acceleration support
- Header-only C++20 implementation
- SIMD-optimized kernels
- Sparse matrix compression
- Memory-mapped I/O support
- Thread-safe implementations

### CURRENTLY WORKING ON 
- !!!EVERYTHING!!!
